Secure file storage in cloud environment using cryptography techniques
## Abstract
In the cloud condition, assets are shared among the majority of the servers, clients and people. So it is troublesome for the cloud supplier to guarantee record security. Thus it is simple for a gatecrasher to access, abuse and demolish the first type of information thus necessitating the use of cryptography to safeguard communication. In this project, the presentation is a comprehensive review of the cryptography algorithms. This project presents a design of data encryption and decryption in a network environment using RSA algorithm and AES algorithms with a specific message. This project provides a description of their encryption and decryption operations, points out their security on the basis of keys, areas of implementation, their strengths and weaknesses during operation. This project also presents an overview in developing a client-server based network between two systems using socket programming. The client server approach is used to display how files can be sent securely between the cloud provider and the client.
